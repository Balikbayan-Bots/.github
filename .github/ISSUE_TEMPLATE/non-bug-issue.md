## Description

A nice description that briefly explains the task and/or final result. (Ex. Create a new subsystem for the claw and commands that will open and close the claw using MotionMagic)

## Context

The reasoning for why a change should be made, and information helpful for beginning the task. (Ex. We wired up the claw motor today, it is a Kraken x60 and we put it on CAN ID 16.)
